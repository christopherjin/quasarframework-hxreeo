    Osteoporosis causes bones to become weak and brittle â€” so brittle that a
    fall or even mild stresses such as bending over or coughing can cause a
    fracture. Osteoporosis-related fractures most commonly occur in the hip,
    wrist or spine. Bone is living tissue that is constantly being broken down
    and replaced. Osteoporosis occurs when the creation of new bone doesn't keep
    up with the loss of old bone. Osteoporosis affects men and women of all
    races. But white and Asian women, especially older women who are past
    menopause, are at highest risk. Medications, healthy diet and weight-bearing
    exercise can help prevent bone loss or strengthen already weak bones.
